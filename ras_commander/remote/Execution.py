    Execute HEC-RAS plans in parallel across multiple remote workers.

    Plans are assigned as worker capacity becomes available, respecting each
    worker's queue_priority (lower values execute first).

    Args:
        plan_numbers: Single plan number or list of plan numbers to execute

        ras_object: RasPrj object for the project. If None, uses global ras.

        force_geompre: Clear cached geometry products in place and force execution
        force_rerun: Force execution even if results are current. When False (default),
            checks file modification times and skips if results are current.
        max_concurrent: Maximum concurrent executions (default: sum of all worker slots)
        autoclean: Delete temporary worker folders after execution (default True).
                   Set to False for debugging to preserve worker folders.
        copy_geometry_outputs: Copy geometry outputs back after local or PsExec execution
            (default True for backward compatibility). Concurrent plans sharing
            a geometry can race during copyback; use False for scenario ensembles
            that share preprocessed geometry.

    Returns:
        Dict mapping plan_number to ExecutionResult

    Example:
        # Initialize workers
        worker1 = init_ras_worker("psexec", hostname="PC1", ...)
        worker2 = init_ras_worker("psexec", hostname="PC2", ...)

    Scheduling:
        Workers are sorted by queue_priority (ascending). Plans are submitted only
        when a worker has an available capacity slot, so faster workers can take
        later plans without oversubscribing slower hosts.

    Multi-Core Workers:
        Effective capacity is the smaller of the worker's configured
        max_parallel_plans and cores_total // num_cores. For example, a worker
        configured for 4 plans but given num_cores=8 and cores_total=16 runs at
        most 2 plans simultaneously.
